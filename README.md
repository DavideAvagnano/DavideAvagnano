## Hi there 👋
I'm [Davide](https://portfolio-website-blond-phi.vercel.app/), an ex aerospace engineering student turned coder 👨‍💻.<br/><br/>
My primarily interest is ***full-stack development***. I’m fascinated by large-scale and high-impact products, and I like to contribute to their creation and development.<br/><br/>
When I'm not coding, I follow the development of the blockchain world.
